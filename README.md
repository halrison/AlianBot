# Alianbot

Alianbot is a web-based application composed of a .NET backend and a React frontend. It is designed as a full-stack project, likely for managing or interacting with some form of data such as songs, members, and votes, as suggested by the backend entities.

## Features

- **Backend**: Built with ASP.NET (VB.NET), using Entity Framework for ORM.
  - Provides RESTful API endpoints for resources like songs, members, and votes.
  - Follows standard MVC patterns with controllers for commands and voting.
  - Includes an API help page and autogenerated sample data for API documentation.

- **Frontend**: Built with React and powered by [Refine](https://refine.dev/).
  - Modern CRUD interface for interacting with backend data.
  - Uses Ant Design for UI components.
  - Supports local development and deployment via Vite.
